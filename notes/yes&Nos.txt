custom scroll bars are awesome, get rid of normal
static/imoveable sites suck
paralax is mint
mouse movement affecting the background in some way is LIT
light/dark mode toggle on the page with a nice transition between styles
One page is ideal, moving to other pages feels janky
If needed, loading screens and loading bars slap!
A logo with 'C' would be sick

Focus on small, interactive elements
